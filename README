URY Player for Java
===================

This project seeks to create a Java application and applet, based 
on the same basecode, that allows streaming from the University Radio 
York MP3 streaming service.

The application spin has been tested as working on OpenJDK/GNU/Linux; 
the applet is currently suffering from issues (likely applet security) 
that preclude working under OpenJDK, though an earlier build ran 
successfully on Oracle's JRE.

Features include:

- Quality selection (high, low, mobile)
- Webcam fetcher (can be disabled)
- Minimalist Swing user interface


You will need:
--------------

The following libraries need to be in classpath (or /lib in eclipse, 
etc) but are not distributed in the github:

- tritonus_share.jar
- jl1.0.1.jar
- mp3spi1.9.5.jar

Later versions might also work.

The Eclipse project files are included in this repository.


Usage
-----

The URYPlayer class in uryPlayer.standalone contains the entry point for 
the standalone application version of the URY Player for Java.

The URYApplet class in uryPlayer.applet contains the entry point for the 
applet version - note that the applet does not provide a user interface, 
as it is expected that a JavaScript control set will eventually be 
provided to interact with it.


Licence
-------

See COPYING.


Known Issues
------------

- Very much tied into the URY system - future versions may be more 
  generalised.

- URYApplet does not work in OpenJDK, seemingly.  URYPlayer does.

- No "get current broadcast details" feature - this is expected to be 
  implemented later after a push service is added.
